Some Context:

The website is a ticketing app for developer (similar to Jira), the main idea was to create an application that would have a role based authentication/authorization. The user will have different tabs available based on his role.
The role part is being made through Auth0, the website used their tokens to exchange with the backend. The app being aimed toward companies we deactived the option to create and account.
In order to navigate the website please use those credentials which will grant you a mock admin access.
